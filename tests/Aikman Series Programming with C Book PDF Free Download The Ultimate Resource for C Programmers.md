However, the book is not without its drawbacks. Some of the drawbacks are:
 
- The book is outdated and does not cover the latest features and standards of C language.
- The book has some errors and typos in the code and text.
- The book does not provide solutions or hints for the exercises and projects.
- The book does not cover some important topics such as pointers, arrays, strings, structures, unions, dynamic memory allocation, and recursion.

Therefore, the book may not be suitable for advanced or intermediate programmers who want to learn more about C language. It may also not be compatible with some modern compilers and platforms.
 
Aikman Series Programming with C is a book that can help beginners to learn the fundamentals of programming with C language. However, it is not a comprehensive or up-to-date guide for C language. Readers who want to learn more about C language may need to look for other sources or books.

If you are interested in reading Aikman Series Programming with C, you may be able to find a copy online or in a library. However, you should be aware that the book may not be available for free download legally. Some websites may offer a PDF version of the book, but they may not have the permission or the rights to do so. Downloading or sharing such files may violate the copyright laws and the intellectual property rights of the authors and the publishers.
 
Therefore, it is advisable to purchase a legal copy of the book from a reputable source or to borrow it from a library. This way, you can support the authors and the publishers and avoid any legal issues. You can also benefit from having a physical copy of the book that you can refer to anytime and anywhere.

Aikman Series Programming with C is a book that can help you learn the basics of programming with C language. However, it is not a complete or current reference for C language. You may need to supplement your learning with other sources or books that cover more topics and features of C language. You may also need to practice your skills by writing and running your own programs using a suitable compiler and platform.

Some of the topics and features of C language that are not covered by Aikman Series Programming with C are:

- Pointers: Pointers are variables that store the address of another variable or memory location. They are useful for manipulating data and memory dynamically and efficiently. They are also essential for working with arrays, strings, structures, unions, and functions.
- Arrays: Arrays are collections of variables of the same type that are stored in contiguous memory locations. They are useful for storing and processing multiple data items of the same kind. They can be one-dimensional or multi-dimensional.
- Strings: Strings are sequences of characters that are terminated by a null character. They are useful for storing and manipulating text data. They can be represented as arrays of characters or as pointers to characters.
- Structures: Structures are user-defined data types that can group different types of variables together. They are useful for representing complex data items that have multiple attributes or properties. They can be accessed using dot notation or pointer notation.
- Unions: Unions are user-defined data types that can store different types of variables in the same memory location. They are useful for saving memory space and for implementing type conversions. They can be accessed using dot notation or pointer notation.
- Dynamic Memory Allocation: Dynamic memory allocation is the process of allocating and freeing memory at runtime using pointers and functions such as malloc, calloc, realloc, and free. It is useful for creating and manipulating data structures that have variable size and lifetime.
- Recursion: Recursion is the technique of defining a function in terms of itself. It is useful for solving problems that have a recursive nature or structure, such as factorial, Fibonacci, binary search, tree traversal, etc.

These topics and features of C language are important and powerful tools for programming. However, they also require careful and proper use to avoid errors and bugs. Therefore, it is advisable to learn them from reliable and updated sources or books that explain them clearly and thoroughly.
