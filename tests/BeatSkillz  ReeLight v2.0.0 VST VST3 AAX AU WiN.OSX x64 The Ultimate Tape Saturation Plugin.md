## ReeLight v2.0.0 in action
 
We tested ReeLight v2.0.0 on a variety of tracks, including drums, bass, guitar, vocals, synths and piano. We used the default settings for each track, and then tweaked the parameters to suit our taste and goals. Here are some of the results we obtained:
 
- Drums: ReeLight v2.0.0 added punch and weight to the drums, making them sound more lively and dynamic. The tape drive control allowed us to dial in the right amount of saturation and distortion, without losing clarity or definition. The wow and flutter controls added some subtle movement and variation to the drum loop, making it sound more organic and realistic.
- Bass: ReeLight v2.0.0 enhanced the low end of the bass, giving it more depth and presence. The tape speed control allowed us to choose between a tighter and brighter sound (15 ips) or a warmer and smoother sound (7.5 ips). The noise control added some grit and texture to the bass, making it cut through the mix better.
- Guitar: ReeLight v2.0.0 added warmth and color to the guitar, making it sound more rich and full. The bias control allowed us to adjust the amount of compression and harmonic distortion, creating different tones and timbres. The high frequency trim control allowed us to tame or boost the high end of the guitar, depending on the desired brightness.
- Vocals: ReeLight v2.0.0 added character and smoothness to the vocals, making them sound more polished and professional. The mix control allowed us to blend the dry and wet signals, creating a subtle or more pronounced effect. The oversampling control improved the sound quality and reduced aliasing artifacts, especially on higher frequencies.
- Synths: ReeLight v2.0.0 added interest and movement to the synths, making them sound more lively and dynamic. The tape type control allowed us to choose between different types of tape machines, each with its own sonic characteristics and quirks. The flutter control added some modulation and pitch variation to the synths, creating a vintage feel.
- Piano: ReeLight v2.0.0 added warmth and body to the piano, making it sound more natural and realistic. The input gain control allowed us to adjust the level of saturation and distortion, creating a clean or dirty sound. The noise type control allowed us to choose between different types of noise sources, such as hiss, hum or crackle.

As you can see, ReeLight v2.0.0 can work well on different types of audio material, adding tape saturation effects that can enhance your tracks in various ways.
