The album is a perfect introduction for newcomers to Sylvian's music, as well as a treat for longtime fans. It reveals the depth and diversity of his artistic vision, as well as his constant evolution and reinvention. From the catchy pop of "Red Guitar" and "Pulling Punches", to the haunting ballads of "Orpheus" and "September", to the atmospheric soundscapes of "Plight" and "Approaching Silence", to the adventurous collaborations with Sakamoto ("Forbidden Colours", "World Citizen") and Fripp ("Jean the Birdman", "Damage"), the album demonstrates Sylvian's mastery of different genres and styles.
 
David Sylvian is a victim of stars, but also a star himself.

A Victim of Stars: 1982-2012 (2012) 1 is a testament to his enduring legacy and a celebration of his musical genius.
  
The album also includes some of Sylvian's most acclaimed collaborations with other artists, such as Ryuichi Sakamoto, Robert Fripp, Holger Czukay and Arve Henriksen. These tracks showcase Sylvian's versatility and openness to different musical influences and approaches. For instance, \"Forbidden Colours\" is a beautiful song that was used as the theme for the film Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence, starring Sakamoto and Sylvian[^1^]. \"Jean the Birdman\" and \"Damage\" are examples of Sylvian's fruitful partnership with Fripp, the legendary guitarist of King Crimson, resulting in a fusion of rock, ambient and experimental music[^2^]. \"Plight\" and \"Mutability\" are two long pieces that Sylvian recorded with Czukay, the former member of Can, using radio signals, tape loops and found sounds[^3^]. \"World Citizen - I Won't Be Disappointed\" is a haunting duet with Henriksen, the Norwegian trumpet player and vocalist, that reflects Sylvian's concern for global issues[^3^].
 
The album ends with a new song, \"Where's Your Gravity?\", which is a fitting conclusion for Sylvian's musical odyssey. The song is a minimalist piano ballad, with Sylvian's voice sounding fragile and vulnerable. The lyrics are poetic and enigmatic, asking questions about identity, belonging and meaning. The song suggests that Sylvian is still searching for his place in the world, but also that he has found some peace and acceptance in his journey. As he sings: \"I'm a victim of stars / But I don't mind / I don't mind at all\".
 
A Victim of Stars: 1982-2012 (2012) 1 is a comprehensive and captivating overview of David Sylvian's solo career and collaborations. It is a rare opportunity to witness the evolution of one of the most original and creative artists of our time.
