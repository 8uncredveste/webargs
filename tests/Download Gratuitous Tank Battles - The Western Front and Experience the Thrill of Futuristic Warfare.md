These are websites that allow you to upload and download files without using a torrent client. You can find direct download links on various forums or blogs that share games.

You should also check the file size and format before downloading, as they might not match the game files.

The main attraction of this DLC is the new campaign, which features eight new maps. Four of them are set in the past, where you can only use units from 1939-1945, such as Tiger and Panther tanks, Calliope Sherman tanks, and other American and German hardware. These maps are more challenging and realistic, as you have to deal with limited resources and technology. The other four maps are set in the present day, where you can use any units you want, including mechs, shields, and lasers. These maps are more fun and chaotic, as you can unleash your creativity and experiment with different combinations.
 
The new campaign also introduces 16 new enemies to defend against, 16 new tank hulls to customize, and 5 new weapons modules to equip. These add more diversity and replayability to the game, as you can try different strategies and tactics to overcome the enemy. You can also use these new units in any other map or mode, or even create your own maps with them using the built-in level editor.
 
The DLC also comes with some minor improvements and bug fixes, such as better graphics, sound effects, and performance. However, the DLC is not without its flaws. Some of the maps are too easy or too hard, depending on your skill level and preferences. Some of the units are too similar or too unbalanced, making some of them obsolete or overpowered. And some of the bugs and crashes that plagued the base game are still present in the DLC.
 
In conclusion, **Gratuitous Tank Battles - The Western Front** is a decent DLC that adds more content and variety to **Gratuitous Tank Battles**. It offers a new campaign that mixes historical and futuristic units in eight new maps, as well as new enemies, tank hulls, and weapons modules to play with. However, it also suffers from some issues with balance, difficulty, and stability. If you are a fan of **Gratuitous Tank Battles**, you might enjoy this DLC for its novelty and challenge. But if you are looking for a polished and refined experience, you might be disappointed by this DLC.
