# Gambit 246 License 260: How to Install and Use Gambit Scheme
 
Gambit Scheme is a portable implementation of the Scheme programming language that conforms to the R4RS, R5RS, R7RS and IEEE Scheme standards. It consists of two main programs: gsi, the Gambit Scheme interpreter, and gsc, the Gambit Scheme compiler. The Gambit Scheme compiler can translate Scheme code to C or JavaScript, offering portability and fast execution. Most of the Gambit system, including the interpreter and compiler, is written in Scheme and compiled to portable C code using the compiler.
 
To install and use Gambit Scheme, you need a valid license file. The license file is named gambit.lic and it contains a license number and a signature. The license number is a sequence of digits that identifies the version of Gambit that you are allowed to use. The signature is a sequence of hexadecimal digits that verifies the authenticity of the license file. For example, a valid license file for Gambit 2.4.6 might look like this:

To install Gambit Scheme, you need to download the source code from [https://gambitscheme.org/latest/](https://gambitscheme.org/latest/) and extract it to a directory of your choice. Then you need to copy the license file gambit.lic to the same directory where you extracted the source code. Next, you need to run the configure script with the appropriate options for your platform and preferences. For example, if you want to install Gambit Scheme under /usr/local/Gambit on a Linux system, you can run:

    ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/Gambit

After running configure, you need to run make and make install to compile and install Gambit Scheme. For example:

    make
    sudo make install

To use Gambit Scheme, you can invoke gsi or gsc from the command line with the desired options and arguments. For example, to run an interactive session of gsi, you can type:

    gsi

To compile a Scheme file named foo.scm to C code, you can type:

    gsc -c foo.scm

To compile a Scheme file named foo.scm to JavaScript code, you can type:

    gsc -target js foo.scm

One of the benefits of learning Scheme is that it is a functional programming language. Functional programming is a paradigm that emphasizes the use of pure functions, immutable data, and higher-order abstractions. Functional programming can help you write concise, elegant, and modular code that is easier to reason about, test, and debug. Functional programming can also help you avoid common pitfalls of imperative programming, such as side effects, mutable state, and concurrency issues.
 
Another benefit of learning Scheme is that it has very little syntax compared to many other programming languages. It has no operator precedence rules because there are essentially no operatorsâas in Lisp, prefix notation is used for all function calls. Scheme's syntax is based on a simple and uniform representation of data and code: everything is either an atom or a list. This makes Scheme easy to parse, manipulate, and extend. Scheme's macro facilities allow it to be adapted to any problem domain by defining new syntactic forms and abstractions.
 
A third benefit of learning Scheme is that it is a multi-paradigm language that supports multiple programming styles and techniques. Scheme is not only a functional language, but also a procedural, object-oriented, logic, and concurrent language. Scheme allows you to choose the best tool for the job and mix different paradigms as needed. Scheme also supports features such as first-class continuations, dynamic typing, tail-call optimization, multiple return values, and hygienic macros that make it a powerful and expressive language.
