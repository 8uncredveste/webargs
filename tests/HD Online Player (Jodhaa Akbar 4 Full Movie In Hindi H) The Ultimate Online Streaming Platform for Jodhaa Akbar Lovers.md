## Why You Should Avoid Password Hacking Tools Without Survey
  
There are many reasons why you should not trust any website or app that claims to hack passwords without survey. Here are some of them:
  
- They are illegal and unethical. Hacking someone else's password without their consent is a violation of their privacy and security. You could face legal consequences if you are caught doing so.
- They are fake and useless. Most of these tools do not work at all, or they only work for very weak passwords that can be easily guessed or cracked by other methods. They may also require you to download or install some software that is actually malware or spyware that can harm your device or steal your data.
- They are risky and expensive. Some of these tools may ask you to complete a survey, enter your email address, phone number, credit card details, or other personal information before giving you the password. However, this is just a trick to collect your data and use it for spamming, phishing, identity theft, or fraud. You may also end up paying for a subscription or a service that you do not need or want.

Therefore, you should never trust any password hacking tool without survey, as they are more likely to cause you trouble than help you.
