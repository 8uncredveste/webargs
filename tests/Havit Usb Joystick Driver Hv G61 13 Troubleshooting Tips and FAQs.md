- If your joystick is not detected by Windows, try plugging it into a different USB port or using a different USB cable. Make sure the cable is not damaged or loose.
- If your joystick is detected but the vibration feature does not work, make sure you have installed the driver correctly. You can uninstall and reinstall the driver following the steps above. You can also try to update the driver from Device Manager.
- If your joystick works but the buttons or axes are not mapped correctly, you can use a third-party software to remap them. One example is [X360CE](https://www.x360ce.com/), which can emulate an Xbox 360 controller for your joystick. You can download it from [this link](https://www.x360ce.com/) and follow the instructions on the website.
- If your joystick causes interference with other devices or programs, you can try to disable the vibration feature. To do this, open the Game Controllers window in Control Panel and select your joystick. Click Properties and then Settings. Uncheck the Enable Force Feedback box and click OK.
