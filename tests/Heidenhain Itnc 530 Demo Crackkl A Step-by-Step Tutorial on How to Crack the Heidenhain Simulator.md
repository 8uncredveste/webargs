# How to Crack the Heidenhain Itnc 530 Demo Version
 
The Heidenhain Itnc 530 is a CNC software that allows users to program and simulate machining operations on a PC. The software is based on the iTNC 530 control, which is widely used in the metalworking industry. The software has a demo version that can be downloaded for free from the Heidenhain website[^4^], but it has a limitation of 100 lines of code per program.
 
Some users may want to crack the demo version and remove this limitation, so they can create longer and more complex programs. There are some videos on YouTube that claim to show how to do this, such as [^1^] and [^2^], but they are not very reliable or safe. They involve modifying system files, using hex editors, or downloading suspicious files from unknown sources. These methods may damage your computer, expose you to malware, or violate the license agreement of the software.
