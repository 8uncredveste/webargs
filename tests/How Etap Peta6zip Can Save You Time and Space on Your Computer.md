The collection consists of 100 items, each with a different combination of colors, shapes, and backgrounds. The items are minted as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain and are available for purchase on OpenSea, a popular marketplace for digital assets[^2^]. Each item has a name that follows the format "Etap Peta6zip - [number]", such as "Etap Peta6zip - 42" or "Etap Peta6zip - 77".
 
Cretsgwijip has also released a soundtrack for the collection, titled "Etap Peta6zip", which can be streamed on SoundCloud[^3^]. The soundtrack is composed of electronic beats and sounds that match the aesthetic of the artworks. Cretsgwijip claims that the soundtrack was also generated using ETAP software, by converting the electrical signals into audio waves.
 
Etap Peta6zip is a new trend in NFT art that showcases the creative potential of ETAP software and the electrical engineering domain. The collection has attracted many buyers and admirers who appreciate the originality and diversity of the artworks. Cretsgwijip has not revealed their identity or their motivation for creating the collection, but has hinted that they might release more works in the future.
