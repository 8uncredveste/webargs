# Native Instruments Homecooked TinyToolz: A Collection of Useful Tools for NI Users
 
Native Instruments is one of the leading companies in the field of music production software and hardware, offering a wide range of products such as Kontakt, Maschine, Reaktor, Komplete and more. However, sometimes users may encounter some challenges or difficulties when working with these products, such as managing libraries, editing registry entries, locating serial numbers, extracting files and so on. That's why a user named Tracer has created and shared a collection of useful tools for NI users, called Homecooked TinyToolz.
 
Homecooked TinyToolz is a pack of six applications that can help NI users with various tasks related to their products. The pack includes the following tools:

- NI-NicntGenerator: A tool that can generate .nicnt files for custom Kontakt libraries, which are needed to add them to the library tab.
- NI-Libdropper: A tool that can add or remove custom Kontakt libraries from the library tab by drag and drop.
- NI-RegExplorer: A tool that can explore and edit the registry entries related to NI products, such as serial numbers, paths, versions and so on.
- NI-SnpidLocator: A tool that can locate the serial numbers of NI products in the registry or in text files.
- NI-XpSupport: A tool that can enable or disable the XP compatibility mode for NI products, which may be needed for some older versions or systems.
- NI-Xtract: A tool that can extract the contents of .zip or .rar files that contain NI products or libraries.

Homecooked TinyToolz is a free and unofficial pack that Tracer has shared with the audio community on AudioZ[^1^], a website dedicated to music production software and samples. Tracer has also provided a readme file with more details and instructions on how to use each tool. The pack is compatible with Windows only and has been tested on Windows 7 and 8.1. Tracer has also updated some of the tools since their initial release in 2015.
 
If you are an NI user who wants to simplify some of the tasks related to their products, you may want to check out Homecooked TinyToolz and see if they can help you. You can download the pack from AudioZ[^1^] or from other file hosting services using LinkSnappy[^1^], a service that allows you to download from more than 100 file hosters at once. However, please note that Homecooked TinyToolz is not an official or endorsed product by Native Instruments, and you should use it at your own risk and discretion. Always backup your files and registry before making any changes.
