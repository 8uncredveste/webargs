## Step 1: Choose Your Venue and Layout
 
The first step to design your event with Vivien is to choose your venue and layout. You can either import a floor plan PDF from the venue or use Vivien's wizard tools to create one in seconds. Vivien's wizard tools allow you to create floorplans based on the dimensions, shape, and style of your venue. You can also add walls, doors, windows, stairs, and other architectural elements to your floorplan[^2^].
 
Once you have your floorplan ready, you can switch to the 3D view and see how your venue looks like in realistic detail. You can also adjust the lighting, shadows, and textures of your venue to match the time of day and the mood of your event.
 
## Step 2: Add Furniture and Equipment
 
The next step is to add furniture and equipment to your event design. Vivien's library is filled with realistic 3D objects designed with scaled accuracy based on industry standards. You can find everything from tables, chairs, sofas, bars, stages, podiums, screens, projectors, speakers, microphones, trusses, lights, curtains, plants, flowers, balloons, and more[^1^]. You can simply drag and drop these objects into your 2D or 3D plot and arrange them as you wish.
 
Vivien also has some special features for adding specific types of objects. For example, you can use the seating wizard to automatically generate seating arrangements based on the number of guests and the style of seating[^2^]. You can also use the truss wizard to create custom truss structures with ease[^2^]. You can also use the projection wizard to simulate how your projection will look like on different surfaces[^2^]. And you can use the pipe and drape wizard to create elegant drapery for your event[^2^].
 
## Step 3: Add People and Decorations
 
The final step is to add people and decorations to your event design. This will make your visualization more lively and realistic. You can add people from Vivien's library, which includes mannequins, people in casual or business attires, or people in various positions[^3^]. You can also import custom objects from other sources or draw them yourself in Vivien[^3^]. You can then place these people in your event design and adjust their size, orientation, and pose.
 
You can also add decorations from Vivien's library or create your own. You can find objects such as banners, signs, logos, posters, flags, ribbons, confetti, candles, cake stands, etc. You can also add effects such as fog machines, lasers, fireworks, etc. You can also use Vivien's new features such as light emission glow and bump mapping to create more realistic effects for your objects[^2^].
 
## Step 4: Preview and Export Your Event Design
 
Once you have completed your event design with Vivien, you can preview it in different ways. You can use the virtual view feature to see how your event will look like from different angles and perspectives. You can also use the VR feature to experience your event in an immersive way. You can even use the companion mode to control some VR features on behalf of the person experiencing it[^2^]. This is perfect for presenting your event design to your clients or colleagues.
