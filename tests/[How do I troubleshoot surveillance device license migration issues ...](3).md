## What You Need
 
Before you start, make sure you have the following:
 
- A Synology NAS or NVR that supports Surveillance Station. You can check the maximum number of supported devices on each model [here](https://www.synology.com/en-us/products/Device_License_Pack).
- Default licenses that come with your Synology device. By default, you can set up two IP cameras on most models. Some models may come with more default licenses or none at all.
- Additional purchased licenses if you want to add more devices. You can buy 1, 4 or 8 Surveillance Device License Packs from authorized resellers. Each pack comes with a single license key that can activate 1, 4 or 8 devices respectively.
- An Internet connection for your Synology device. You need to connect to Synology's Authorization Server to activate or deactivate license keys.
